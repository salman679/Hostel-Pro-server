## 🛡️ Secure Practices  

1. **Environment Variables**: All sensitive data (keys and secrets) are stored in `.env`.  
2. **Password Hashing**: User passwords are hashed using bcrypt for added security.  
3. **Token Expiry**: JWTs include expiration to ensure session security.  
4. **Validation**: Input fields are validated to prevent invalid or malicious data.
